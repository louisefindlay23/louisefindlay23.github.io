# Louise Findlay's Portfolio

## About My Portfolio

My portfolio website is aimed at showcasing my best web development projects from Caravan Rental booking (WooCommerce) sites to mobile web apps. Recently, I started developing a blog (where I can link and cross-post) all my published articles from Section and FreeCodeCamp. 

Originally, a static site built with Github Pages, I converted it to the static site generator, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), hosted on Netlify to retain its blazing fast speed while making it easier to update and maintain.
