				<p>I took photos of the Baker Hughes 10k Run on behalf of the Aberdeen Cyrenians (a charity that helps homeless people in Aberdeen.)</p> 

				<p>I videoed the race at various points as well as taking pictures of the mascots and other racers that they edited and posted on their social media channels.</p>

				<p>As the Society of Recorder Players' Publicity Officer and E-News Editor, I consult regularly with the Web Editors to manage the Society's digital presence.</p>
				
				<p>I helped to craft the brand redesign and have taken the new colour scheme and typography to create flyers, social media branding and update their electronic newsletter.</p>
				
				<p class="hidemedium">Annually, I present a report to the AGM at the National Festival in front of delegates from 51 branches.</p>
					
				<p>Particular highlights I've been proud of were designing an ad for the Dolmetsch 80th anniversary concert programme and creating an interactive timeline of tweets and Facebook posts covering the 80th anniversary National Festival.</p>

				<p>I approached the local Dufftown hairdresser, Hair by Julie to develop a website because they had none. My goal was to emphasise their USPs, their history as the oldest hairdresser in the town and their customer centric friendly behaviour.</p>
				
				<p class="hidemedium">They also wanted my assistance in updating their Google business listing and revamping their Facebook page.</p>
				
				<p>Utilsing their existing branding, I designed a website with carousels for client and employee testimonials that would give users a taste of the Hair by Julie experience.</p>
