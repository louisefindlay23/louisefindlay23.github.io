                <p>I'm a front-end web developer & UX Designer studying for a degree at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen. I design and develop static, dynamic and WordPress websites for individuals, businesses and non-profits.</p>
                <p>I also design mobile apps (both native and web) and develop progressive web apps.</p>
                <p>My speciality is communicating to the client exactly what's happening throughout the entire Software Development process.</p>

                <p>I've developed a variety of responsive websites and mobile web apps from a Aurora Borealis web app to a redesign of the BBC iPlayer mobile app using HTML, CSS and JS for static sites and Express, EJS and MongoDB for dynamic ones.</p>
                <p>As a freelancer, I design and develop dynamic WordPress websites using the Beaver Builder page builder to make it easier for clients to make changes themselves if they so desire or offer ongoing support through care plans.</p>
                <p class="hidemedium hidephone">I've also participated in several hackathons and competitions such as Hack Quarantine and the Digital Skills Partnerships' National Student Software Development competition which has given me the opportunity to work on briefs by CAS and CGI and learn from other developers.</p>

                <p>In my HNC year, I was selected as one of the top four students to travel to Glasgow to take part in the WorldSkills Advanced Web Design heat</p>
                <p>The challenge was to develop a website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery to a mock-up using specified styles within four hours. The conditions were closed-book with no access to the internet so all the coding had to be done through memory.</p>
                <p class="hidemedium hidephone">Some of the techniques that were required were JavaScript form validation, material design stylings, dropdown search menus and tool-tip accessibility.</p>
