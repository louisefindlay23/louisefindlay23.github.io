				<p>I'm a web designer currently studying for my HND at North East Scotland College in Aberdeen. My speciality is getting to the heart of what my clients want and incorprating it into my designs.</p>

				<p>I help brands make their message clearer and have worked with the charity, Aberdeen Cyrenians at their Baker Hughes 10k Run event and actively work with the Society of Recorder Players as their Publicity Officer.</p>

				<p class="hidemedium">In my spare time, I write fantasy short stories and poetry. I've achieved 2nd place in the Dragon Knight Chronicles Underworld/Dark Fantasy Writing Competition and have been published in two anthologies.</p>

				<p>My responsive websites and mobile web apps have ranged from a music enterprise initative called SilverNote to a redesign of the Microsoft Surface website.</p>

				<p>I have experience with the framework, Foundation and content management system, WordPress to speed up development and make it easier for clients to make changes themselves if they so desire.</p>

				<p class="hidemedium">Group projects such as overhauling the BBC iPlayer mobile app and crafting a website for the SilverNote Music brand exposed me to the style and workflow of other developers that I could learn from.</p>

				<p>I write a variety of short stories in the fantasy genre starring various mythological beasts and humans with mystical powers. Some feature vampires, demons and seers.</p>

				<p>Some of my poetry has a fantasy slant and others a more natural one. The Magic Christmas Dragon & Other Poetry Tales is my first chapbook (which is a small compliation of poetry.)</p>

				<p class="hidemedium">My work has been featured in two anthologies, Dreamless Roads and The Dragon Tempest. Dreamless Roads is a fantasy anthology that features my poem, The Rogue's Odyssey and the Dragon Tempest is Dragon Knight Chronicles' second contest anthology for their winners.</p>

				<p>I enhance brands by doing other design work apart from designing websites. I've created the aesthetics for physical media such as flyers and advertisements as well as manage their social media presense online.</p>

				<p class="hidemedium">In the past, I've volunteered to work with the charity, Aberdeen Cyrenians to produce an album of photographs and videos for the 2017 Baker Hughes 10K Run event.</p>

				<p>I actively work with the Society of Recorder Players (a UK charity promoting recorder playing with over 50 branches) as their Publicity Officer. I regularly produce their monthly eNewsletter to over 1500 subscribers and manage their Facebook Group and Twitter account.</p>

				<p>In my HNC year, I was selected as one of the top four students to travel to Glasgow to take part in the WorldSkills Advanced Web Design heat</p>
				
				<p>The challenge was to develop a website from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery to a mock-up using specified styles within four hours. The conditions were closed-book with no access to the internet so all the coding had to be done through memory.</p>
				
				<p class="hidemedium">Some of the techniques that were required were JavaScript form validation, material design stylings, dropdown search menus and tool-tip accessibility.</p>
