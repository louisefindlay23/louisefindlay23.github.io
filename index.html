                    <p>"Louise was very helpful in developing my website. When I was unsure exactly what would be required, she made the process easy and responded quickly when I had any questions.</p>
                    <p>I continue to work with her through her Support Care Plan. I can concentrate on my business and use her expertise in keeping my website fast, safe and secure."</p>

                    <p>"Louise was instrumental in bringing my business online. I tried to do it myself but found the process complicated and confusing. She talked me through every step and she suggested alternatives that would be easier to use.</p>
                    <p>I needed a simple drag and drop interface so I could make changes myself so she installed a WordPress page builder and demonstrated how to use it."</p>

                <p>I developed a WordPress website using WooCommerce Bookings and Deposits and the page builder combo, Beaver Builder and Beaver Themer to easily develop the functionality needed in such a short time.</p>
                <p>The site was launched in the four day deadline and was a great success with the first booking made within twelve hours of launch.</p>
