                    <p>"Louise was instrumental in bringing my business online. I tried to do it myself but found the process complicated and confusing. She talked me through every step and she suggested alternatives that would be easier to use.</p>
                    <p>I needed a simple drag and drop interface so I could make changes myself so she installed a WordPress page builder and demonstrated how to use it."</p>

                <p>Having never done any back-end development or database work before, in two weeks I implemented a photo-uploading system (using Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Multer and Sharp.)</p>
