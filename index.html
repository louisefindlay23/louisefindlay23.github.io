                <p>My project for Hack Quarantine (a COVID-19 themed virtual hackathon) was to create a landing page for Needs & Offers, a web app from San Francisco startup, Drag Labs. I designed the landing page using Adobe XD, taking inspiration from the web app and developed it using HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
                <p>I was also one of the top three most active participants out of 5,323 hackers.</p>
