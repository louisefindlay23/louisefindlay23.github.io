                <p>Aurora is a web application that helps to find the best locations for observing the Aurora Borealis in Great Britain.

                <p>Having never done any back-end development or database work before, in two weeks I implemented a photo-uploading system (using Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Multer and Sharp.)</p>

                <p>My project for Hack Quarantine (a COVID-19 themed virtual hackathon) was to create a landing page for Needs & Offers, a web app from San Francisco startup, Drag Labs. I designed the landing page using Adobe XD, taking inspiration from the web app and developed it using HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
                <p>I was also one of the top three most active participants out of 5,323 hackers.</p>

                <p>One of my freelance clients, Jane Clark required a website where participants could book a space in her classes and pay using PayPal. It needed to be usable for her less tech-savvy audience and to clearly differentiate events that take place at both venues.</p>
                <p>I set up Tribe Commerce integration with the Events Calendar and Events Ticket plugins and made changes to the UX based on user feedback.</p>

                <p>I approached the local Dufftown hairdresser, Hair by Julie to develop a website because they had none. My goal was to emphasise their USPs, their history as the oldest hairdresser in the town and their customer centric friendly behaviour.</p>
                <p>Utilising their existing colour scheme and shop signage, I created a logo and typography for their branding. I designed a website with carousels for client and employee testimonials that would give users a taste of the Hair by Julie experience.</p>

                <p>Following on from the SilverNote project, we were assigned to create a mobile web app prototype for BBC iPlayer. We divided the site into eight sections and took two each. Once the skeleton was created, I worked on the carousel and search areas.</p>
                <p>As it was a mobile app, the carousel had to be touch-friendly so I used the plugin, Flickity which was easy to use and very customisable. When the TV Show section was complete, it was integrated together so clicking on a cell showed metadata from the TVDB.</p>
