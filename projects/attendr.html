project_description: |
    In 24 hours, I created an interactive web element to include on the Attendr website (an attendence app for university students) for the hackathon, RGUHack2020.<br></br>
    Their existing website contained a slider of screenshots of the mobile app so I decided the interactivity could be improved by creating a mobile web app where users could interact with the app to act as a demo.<br></br>
    Attendr were so impressed with what was accomplished in just 24 hours that we won the Attendr Design challenge and asked to continue development in a freelance capacity.<br></br>
    The screenshots displayed are from the final version developed after the hackathon but you can view the hackathon prototype via the Github Repo link below.<br></br>
