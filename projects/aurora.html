project_description: |
    For this project, I was teamed up with a designer and two software developers and I taught them how to use source control which resulted in a 50% reduction in merge conflicts. I also supported the designer who was learning how to code by screensharing with him using Teamviewer. My help allowed him to contribute code to the project.<br></br>
    In my first time working with databases and doing back-end development, I implemented a photo-uploading system (using Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Multer and Sharp) in just two weeks.<br></br>
    An example of the feature is when users register, they can upload a profile photo (which is stored on the server via Multer and resized using Sharp.) Their photo is then displayed on their profile by storing the filepath in a MongoDB database and then displayed on the front-end using EJS templating.<br></br>
    Overall, I contributed 70% of the code for the web app.
