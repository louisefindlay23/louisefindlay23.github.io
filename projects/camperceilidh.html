project_description: |
    Eileen O'Farrell, the director of Camperceilidh, needed a booking website so she could start her campervan rental business within a week.<br></br>
    Having originally bought a template (that was clunky, americanised and too complicated for her to use), I quickly developed a prototype website in four hours to show her the brand design I had envisoned.<br></br>
    Pleased that I'd designed exactly what she'd imagined, I added e-commerce functionality for booking rentals and deposits while communicating with her throughout the entire process to explain how the site would be developed.<br></br>
    The site was launched in the four day deadline and was a great success with the first booking made within twelve hours of launch.<br></br>
    Post launch, I gave a two hour training session to teach her how to manage her website, Google Analytics and Google Search Console. I also assisted her to convert to a Business PayPal account and create a Facebook page to promote her business.
