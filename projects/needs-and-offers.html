                    <p>San-Francisco start-up, Drag Labs had an iOS app, CoCre8 which they wanted to fork and develop into a social marketplace web app as part of Hack Quarantine. I joined the project as a Front-End Developer/UX Designer to improve their app design and create a landing page.</p>
                    <p>Using Slack, Figma and Adobe XD's collaborative features, I designed mock-ups for desktop, tablet and mobiles and worked with the rest of the team despite some of us residing in the UK, USA and Cuba.</p>
                    <p>Once the designs were approved, I developed the landing page as a static site (for fast loading times) which was deployed through continuous integration from Gitlab to AWS.</p>
                    <p>As one of the top three most active participants in the hackathon out of 5,323 hackers, I was featured in their closing ceremony.</p>
