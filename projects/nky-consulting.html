project_description: |
    NKY Consulting wanted to refresh their website and make it more attractive by including images and infographics. By modifying the site's PHP templates, I overhauled the layout by adding full-width images to explain NKY Consulting's services.<br></br>
    Their existing website contained a slider of screenshots of the mobile app so I decided the interactivity could be improved by creating a mobile web app where users could interact with the app to act as a demo.<br></br>
    The navigation was simplified by adding a drop-down menu and moving the Contact Form to a section on every page.<br></br>
    I also handled speed and image optimisation which resulted in a 50% reduction in page loading time<br></br>

project_testimonial: |
    "Louise helped me with a refresh of my company website, NKY Consulting. I wanted to update the wording and graphics of the website, and required someone to work on the mechanics of this within WordPress.<br><br/>
    I was extremely pleased with the services Louise provided. She went beyond my expectations with input on the best structure for the wording and images I was updating.<br><br/>
    After an initial Zoom call to discuss the project, Louise was able to implement the changes I desired. Her communication and understanding of the project was excellent, as was her dedication to complete the project within the desired timeframe.<br><br/>
    Overall, I was very impressed by the services provided by Louise and would use her services again in the future."
