				<p>SilverNote Music is a music enterprise hub in Aberdeen that want to promote new music. They tasked me and three others to work as a team to create a responsive website that catered to those viewing on computers as well as a younger, mobile audience.</p>
				
				<p>My main responsibilities were communicating with our client and developing the artist page. I pitched the prototype to the wider organisation and gathered feedback from the band members. This feedback informed the music players I created on the artist profiles.</p>

				<p>Following on from the SilverNote project, we were assigned to create a mobile web app prototype for BBC iPlayer. We divided the website into eight sections and took two each. Once the skeleton was created, I worked on the carousel and search areas.</p>
				
				<p>As it was a mobile app, the carousel had to be touch-friendly so I used the plugin, Flickity which was easy to use and very customisable. When the TV Show section was complete, it was integrated together so clicking on a cell showed metadata from the TVDB.</p>
				
				<p>Originally, the search section was meant to be a prototype because our host, Github didn't allow databases. However, I still wanted to get it work. I used a mixture of jQuery and JavaScript to create a dropdown menu with filterFunction which would narrow down search results when typed and keep the history of searches.</p>

				<p>I was tasked to research a framework to create a website to drive creative novices to use the Microsoft Surface line of products. I chose Foundation because it gave me the freedom to design my own custom layout and using its stylings only when needed.</p>
				
				<p>I decided to focus on three categories of people, beginners with little technical profiency, students studying the creative and digital arts and travellers who are always on the go and love to explore new things.</p>
				
				<p>I wanted to create a strong visual focus by having a prominent hero video and build trustworthiness by including testimonials.</p>

				<p>I approached the local Dufftown hairdresser, Hair by Julie to develop a website because they had none. My goal was to emphasise their USPs, their history as the oldest hairdresser in the town and their customer centric friendly behaviour.</p>
				
				<p>They also wanted my assistance in updating their Google business listing and revamping their Facebook page.</p>
				
				<p>Utilsing their existing branding, I designed a website with carousels for client and employee testimonials that would give users a taste of the Hair by Julie experience.</p>
				
				<p>They also sell haircare products and items from local artisans so I captured a host of photographs to include a modal view searchable by brand.</p>
